# pgcopy2insert
Convert a postgresql SQL dump using COPY to load data to one that uses INSERT.

It's very crude, using regexps rather than a real parser. It doesn't handle empty COPY statements, any
of the COPY command modifiers, or quoted null identifiers.

But if you have a moderate amount of SQL generated by pg_dump that uses COPY and you need INSERT, this'll
probably work OK. Probably.

`go build` to build the binary, then `pgcopy2insert <input.sql` to run.
